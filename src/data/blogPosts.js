# MY CAPSTONE PROJECT JOURNEY
During the first week of the Capstone project, we were task to come up a title project that is unique and never been proposed by the previous students. I proposed a project title, but got rejected. Also, my members proposed a project title but then again got rejected. It was stressing and exhausting, yet a wonderful experience to practice our intellectual capacity on composing and creating innovative ideas. Though the process of proposing a title with a brilliant idea is difficult, Me and my members manage to come up a project title that captures the interest of the panels. During the process of proposing the title, it takes a lot of effort to research and gather ideas from different project proposals across the internet. I was overwhelmed during the process of proposing a title, as it needs a lot of ideas and creativity to visualize the system and its use to the community. However, it helps me to be productive and study in different project proposals of the rest of researchers. I gain a lot of knowledge regarding to the project that we proposed. The day of title defense; this day marks the day that we will be defending the project title that we proposed. There will be a panel members that will give comments and recommendations regarding the project that we will be developing. The title defense was successful, we gain insights and feedbacks that surely help the process of developing our system more accurate and efficient. During the development process of our system,it was a roller coaster. I got mix feelings and emotions, I don't even know what to acknowledge. I got frustrated, a lot of things needs to do. The day of Mock defense, this day we already done halfway of our system. Though it lacks a lot of features and functionalities,
 we managed to defend our system. I was happy and relieved that we got a chance to present and finished the system to the finals. During the process along the way, we encounter a lot of errors, we are still gathering some information regarding the project title for us to fully understand the process of our system. Thanks to the panel members who share us some ideas and information that effectively help us to develop the system. And at end of the day, we finally defended the system project. Though there are lot of revisions, still it helps us to improve and organize the idea for the system that we develop.

# ON-THE-JOB TRAINING     
              My Journey in ojt learning experience I'm NOVELYN Q. RAMPOLA, a fourth year student taking Bachelor 
              of Science in Information Technology and this is my OJT experience I started my ojt on the second week of February. Our deployment took place inside the Western Mindanao 
              State University main campus. Me and my groupmates we're deployed on the first day of our on the job training. We are escorted by our professor to the office of the president to be introduced as the intern. 
              The first day is nerve wrecking, as it is our first day of deployment. The first thing that we did was to present ourselves, we get to know the staff members of the office. We were oriented how the office transact the 
              documents that are going in and out of the office, how it should be done and the process of passing the documents from one section to another inside the office. During that day I was thrilled to know more
               about the processes that's been going on inside the office of the president. After the briefing, we are assigned or task to make a system for the office of the president. The system that we will be
                developing is a tracking system. The president wants to track the records and locations of the documents that is being processed inside the office. They want to have a real-time update of the documents whereabouts.
                 During the second day of our ojt, we are still gathering some data and information regarding the process of the office of the president. We ask more details about the processes on how the documents were passed by the department or college 
                 to the office of the president. Also, how the president accept the documents and what confirmation process they do. Me and my groupmates gather at the CCS building to discuss the informations that we collected. I take notes on the important
                  details that we can use for the system. We share ideas and informations to visualize the system to be developed. On the third day of our ojt, me and my members try to come up a design of the system, also the process of how the system should be. 
                  During the day, each of us think of a design that will be used for the system. During the day, we collaborate on different functions to be used on the system development. One of our members created a github repository for collaboration. On the fourth day, we are scheduled to meet with our adviser for consultation 
                  of our system. Also, to gather more information and recommended ideas from our professor. During the day, our professor discuss about the requirements that needs to be compiled for our ojt. After the meeting, we consult the system to our professor, he recommended more features to be added in the system and also how to improve the design. 
                  On the fifth day of our ojt, me and my members decide to have an online meeting. During the meeting, we discuss the additional features and design that our professor suggested. I take notes to the important details that needs to be improved and share it with the members.
                   The meeting last for an hour, which the members take turns to share their opinions and ideas. After the meeting we are back to working on the system. On the sixth day of my ojt, I was assigned to make the weekly report. I listed all the task that 
                   we finished or worked during the whole week. Then I submitted it to our professor to evaluate what are the tasks that we finished during the week and also it serves as our total working hours. This experience is very helpful for me to be trained
                    and learn to manage my time during work hours.      `,

  #MY JOURNEY TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROJECT
  I'm Novelyn Q. Rampola, a fourth year student, taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and this is my Software
 engineering project journey I can say that my journey in software engineering project is somewhat similar to the Capstone project. 
 Yet, there's a difference. During our S.E project as we called, we are task to find a client that will benefit our system and deploy the system to be used.
  At first, me and my members think of who will be our client, it was difficult to find a client because some people don't think that we will be actually deploying the system.
  But then, thanks to the College of Sports Science and Physical Education who trusted us to develop a system for their memorandums and inventory of equipments. During the development, 
  we consult the client of what system they want us to develop, then the design that they wish to be just like any other universities. The associate dean gave us more ideas and informations about the CSSPE, which help us to understand and visualize what system to develop. Throughout the development, we manage to create a system that meets their needs, and provide them a system that effectively help the college to disseminate memorandums inside the CSSPE. I would also like to share our gratitude to the panels who also become part of the improvement of our system through their feedback and recommendations.
 This development process will ot be successful without the people who encourage and support us throughout the journey.

  # MY JOURNEY AS A STUDENT
  I'm Novelyn Q. Rampola, a fourth year student, taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and this is my 
  journey as a student As a student since elementary until to this day as a college, I always find myself wondering what to do after
   finishing my studies. I feel like I'm lost and don't know what I want, until I realize that it's not only me who experience this 
   feeling or stage of life. There are a lot of people who find themselves Wondering what to do, until they finally figure it out.
    Different people have different phases of their lives as they say, and I totally agree with that. Some of batch or school mates 
    are already having their dream job, doing the things they like and achieving their goals. As I saw that, I always doubt myself if 
    I'm doing the right thing or am I in the right path. But then, whenever I feel that way I always pray and trust god of what he knows 
    that's good for me. I'm going to try my best to achieve and discover more about myself rather than looking at others achievements. 
  I want to achieve my goals for this year and strive more to reach that goal.

  # MY JOURNEY AS A STUDENT
  I'm Novelyn Q. Rampola, a fourth year student, taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and this is my journey as an IT student 

  My journey in college of computing studies is amazing, there's a lot of setbacks and doubts yet I continue and strive to finished my studies. At first, I don't have any background or idea about IT. I thought it would be more on Microsoft word, sheets or excel. But then, it is more on programming. I actually chose this course because of my friend and also because I don't know what to take in college. 

During my days in CCS, I've met a lot of amazing people and make friends with. Also, the strict yet friendly professors who teach us every day with their knowledge and wisdom. Even though I cried, laugh and struggle in this college, I will always cherish it. As it was part of my journey as a student and as a person. I don't want to regret nor be sad that I become an IT student, because I know to myself that I've learned something, maybe not mostly in programming but in different field.     `,

  # MY JOURNEY TO PANDEMIC CLASSES 
I'm Novelyn Q. Rampola, a fourth year student, taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and this is my journey to pandemic Era

During the pandemic, classes is boring. There are times that I feel sleepy and tired during the online classes, then thre are times that the electricity is out which makes me skip the class and also, lost of internet Connection that cause a delay of communication. 

This Era was somewhat less educational for some students, it is because they rely on the internet and lack of supervision of the professor, because it was online. Theres also a time where students get lazy doing homework or study.

During the Pandemic Era, I can say that is it difficult and challenging, as I need to make sure that my internet Connection is good, my device is in good condition and also, my presence will be in the class. Sometimes, I get sleepy, especially early meetings or classes. There's also a tendency that I attend class online while in bed, and while I'm having a meal. 

Then, eventually at the second semester of my second year in college, face to face classes is back. For me, it was exciting and nerve wrecking, because for the first time in my college days, I will be meeting my classmates face to face. And I know that introducing yourself is a must. As a shy and introverted person, that is my biggest weakness. I really don't like presenting myself in front a crowd. I always get nervous and shy. But then, as the time goes by, I got used to it especially when classes are continues. It helps me improve myself and gain a little confidence.

Until now, I'm happy to part of the college of computing studies, though I may not be an excellent student but I will always remember that being an IT student is amazing.     `,
